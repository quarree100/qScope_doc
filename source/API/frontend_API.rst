Frontend UDP setup
******************

UDP communication is initialized in `frontend.py`. The frontend object has a thread running for each of the physical tables and links them to each of the :ref:`grids<grid>`, so the grids can receive messages from each of the according tag decoders. Additionally, it starts a third thread to function as an UDP server to receive messages from :ref:`GAMA<ABM>` and forward them to the infoscreen.
Upon initialization, the grids will be allocated a callback function, that is executed whenever a message is received from the tag decoders: read_scanner_data_. In this function, :ref:`the received message<cspy_grid_message>` will be interpreted so the grids can process the id and rotation of each grid cell. It is possible to infer the relative rotation from a previous state, which can be used as means of interaction (which is NOT done in the QUARREE100 project).

.. note::

  The actual UDPServer class can be found in `UDP.py`.

.. _read_scanner_data:

The grid is either updated when interacting with a computer mouse (left- right- or middle-click on the cells) or if the :ref:`tag decoder<cspy>` detects a change in the physical grid. In the latter case, a json-formatted string is sent to the frontend via UDP and decoded in the according grid.

            print("Invalid JSON")
            return

        try:
            # update grid cells
            for y, row in enumerate(self.grid):
                for x, cell in enumerate(row):
                    cell.id, cell.rot = msg['grid'][y * self.x_size + x]

                    cell.selected = cell.id != 5  # any non-white object selects cells

                    # calculate relative rotation
                    if cell.rot == -1:  # an inactive cell has a rotation value of -1
                        cell.rel_rot = 0
                    elif cell.prev_rot != cell.rot:
                        cell.rel_rot = cell.rot - cell.prev_rot if cell.prev_rot > -1 else 0
                    cell.prev_rot = cell.rot

            # update slider values
            # TODO: this causes type error when no slider value provided in cspy â†’ provide 0 by default?
            for slider_id in self.sliders.keys():
                if msg['sliders'][slider_id] is not None: self.sliders[slider_id].value = msg['sliders'][slider_id]
