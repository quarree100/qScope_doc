QUARREE100 (example project)
****************************

The Q-Scope framework was used in the `QUARREE100 <quarree100.de>`_ project. In this section, you'll learn how and what for.

So after starting all the software components correctly, you can now start using the setup. Projected onto the table, you see an aerial photograph of the area of importance for the QUARREE100 project. There are all existing buildings displayed, some marked red. These colored buildings are the ones you can interact with.
On the right side, there is an area for global settings, that is to be used only by the "game master" - a person that guides the whole group of users through the workshop. The area contains some positions to switch through the game modes and a range of fields for some gameplay scenarios.

TODO: image of tokens
For the general user interaction, all users get two tokens with which they can select buildings from the map. By placing one of their tokens onto one of the red houses, the buildings' data will be displayed on the infoscreen (qualitatively): address, type and historical heat- and energy consumption.

You also see predictions of CO2-emissions and energy costs, pre-calculated by the agent-based model. The data is plotted on a timeline up until the year 2045. The aim of the game will be to reduce the emissions and lower the energy costs by choosing from a set of possible measures.

In the QUARREE100 game, actions to choose from all relate to decisions in house heating. There are three options to choose from:

#. energy-saving behavior
#. conducting the renovation of the house
#. connecting the house to the QUARREE100-heat-grid

In order to choose from one of these, you have to put one of your tokens into one of the fields above any of the sliders. Each of the fields represents one of the beforementioned actions. The slider will be activated for you to set the magnitude of your action. Changes will be applied to all houses you have selected simultaneously.

After all users are done with the adjustments, the game master can start the simulation by putting any non-white token onto the global simulation position. The Agent-Based model is thus started and calculates the data for the adjusted buildings.

The game master can now discuss the calculated data with the users in two different visualization modes. Furthermore, they can pre-define the number of buildings connected to the heat grid to influence the calculation of neighborhood emissions and energy costs.
