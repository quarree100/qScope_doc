.. _cspy_slider:

Slider
******

Additionally to the decoding of the grid of tiles, cspy can monitor slider objects, to facilitate gradual setting of values by the user.

#. TODO: explain the algorithm: camera looking for darkes pixel group along bar
#. TODO: explain positioning
#. TODO: information is sent to frontend as float and has to be processed there

TODO: Recommendation: place y-position of slider slightly ABOVE the slid, so you don't try to decode what's on the ceiling and other interferences with people.
