Welcome to qScope's documentation!
==================================

Q-Scope is a framework for interactive visualization using tangible objects on a physical table. It is used as a decision support tool for participation processes in energy transition research. The framework is based on `MIT's CityScope platform <https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/>`_ and was developed by the `Department of Resilient Energy Systems <https://www.uni-bremen.de/res>`_ at the University of Bremen.`

   :alt: Here shall be an image of the Q-Scope setup, showing the two tables with its grids of tangible objects on top, a TV monitor that serves as an infoscreen for metadata and a projector that casts the frontend for user interaction onto the tables. Inside of the tables there are two webcams to scan the grids' current setup at every instance.

The code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/quarree100/qScope_frontend/>`_.
